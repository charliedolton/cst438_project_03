Marcos Orozco Silva - MarcosOS98 Charlie Dolton - charliedolton Andrew Liddle - Edgy-Mcgee Andre Moreno - More3428 Alexander Ventura - Alexander-Ventura Description: For this project our team will develop a Student Assignment Portal where students will be able to view and access their assignments issued by their instructor. The application will be developed using modern web frameworks. This will require the development of a Representational state transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API), a constant integration, constant development (CICD) pipeline, and a persistence (Database) layer. The website should be deployed to a Platform as a Service (PaaS) such as Heroku or Google App Engine. This Repository will act as the WEB Front-End of the project. The Website will have Sessions for Log persistance, it will include a Data persistance Layer, along with docker, thymleaf, oAuth2, and will include unit test for functionality.
